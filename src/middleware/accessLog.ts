/**
 * @module middleware/accessLog
 *
 * Structured access-log middleware for Express routes.
 *
 * Responsibility
 * --------------
 * 1. Resolve the correlation ID for the incoming request using a priority chain:
 *      X-Correlation-Id header  →  X-Request-Id header  →  req.id  →  new UUID
 * 2. Persist the resolved ID on `res.locals.correlationId` so every downstream
 *    handler can reference it without touching AsyncLocalStorage directly.
 * 3. Echo the correlation ID back to the caller via the `X-Correlation-Id`
 *    response header, enabling end-to-end request tracing.
 * 4. Emit a single structured log line on `res.finish` (i.e. after the response
 *    headers and body have been flushed) containing:
 *      - correlationId  : the resolved ID
 *      - method         : HTTP verb
 *      - path           : req.path (path only, no query string — avoids PII in logs)
 *      - statusCode     : HTTP status of the response
 *      - durationMs     : wall-clock time from middleware entry to flush
 *      - ip             : first non-empty value of X-Forwarded-For or req.ip
 *
 * The log name is selected by route prefix so consumers can filter access logs
 * more easily: `/api/users` => `users_access_log`, `/api/auth` =>
 * `auth_access_log`, and `/api/predictions` => `predictions_access_log`.
 *
 * Usage
 * -----
 *   import { accessLog } from "../middleware/accessLog";
 *   router.use(accessLog);               // mount once at the top of the router
 *
 * Security notes
 * --------------
 * - Only `req.path` is logged, not `req.url`, so query-string values (which
 *   may contain tokens or PII) never appear in the log stream.
 * - The correlation ID accepted from the client is length-clamped to 128 chars
 *   and stripped to safe alphanumeric / hyphen / underscore characters before
 *   being trusted, preventing log-injection attacks.
